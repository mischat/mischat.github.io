Since [Newsgators RSS Reader](http://www.newsgator.com/rss-readers.aspx) asked me to supply them with a Google Account, becoming [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader), I gave up on the service. I using an RSS reader which would sync my laptop with my phone and when my phone became capable of reading interwebs when traveling about. In short RSS is awesome, and Google Search is awesome, but I try and spread my personal data thin across many companies instead of giving it all away to one. I used the iGoogle page for a while, but I thought I could just emulate on my website. 

Google off good search, they can have my search history, Facebook offer a good service to stay in contact with your friends, Yahoo/Flickr provide a good photo sharing experience, and well Last.fm do a good job of recommending me music &#8211; get what I am hinting at. I could just used Google to do all of the above, but somehow I feel better spreading it around. 

So, I made a start at a RSS reader on my site : <https://mmt.me.uk/blog/rss/> using this [PHP RSS library](http://www.scriptol.com/rss/rss-reader.php). Sadly, it doesn&#8217;t understand RSS 1.0 which is RDF, it only seems to parse RSS 2.0.
