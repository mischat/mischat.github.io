I have used [Jules blog post](http://jules.fm/Logbook/Logbook.html) to have a go at [iPhone](http://www.apple.com/uk/iphone/) tethering and it seems to work fine. Make sure that if you attempt to tether you should use Jules&#8217;s update&#8217;d howto on 2009-06-18. All you have to do is point your iPhone at the following url <http://www.jules.fm/files/uk.o2.mobileconfig> and you can follow the instruction on how to run it here [http://richardlai.xanga.com/704930537/enable-tethering-on-iphone-30&#8212;too-easy-worldwide-carriers/](http://richardlai.xanga.com/704930537/enable-tethering-on-iphone-30---too-easy-worldwide-carriers/)
