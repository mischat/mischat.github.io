Yay finally, come across an update to the  [GPGMail](http://www.gpgmail.org/) plugin for Mail.app 4.3 on Snow Leopard. This is the one bit of functionality which I have missed since upgrading from Leopard to Snow Leopard, and have been searching for updates periodically for a while now. 

This is fanstatic news, as I can now digitally sign my emails, with my GPG identity, which can be found linked to from my [FOAF file](https://mmt.me.uk/blog/foaf.rdf).
