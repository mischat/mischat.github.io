Semantic Media Wiki Talk 2010-05-07

You can actually query the Semantic Media Wiki,

You can query it you can write 

#ask queries which will let you ask for lists and create lists based on the data within a  
a semantic media wiki. 

You can add in triples, in the form of tags into links, so that you can generate the lists.

Very cool !

You can ask for a timeline, which will then import the data in the Simile Timeline tool. 

It can also export to iCal so that you can import it into iCal.
