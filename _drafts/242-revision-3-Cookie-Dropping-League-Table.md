I need to make two pages be outputted from my perl script for the cookie counting.

Need to make it output html back for each of the cookie pages. Each directory to link to the raw cookie file.

I should also put up the algorithm which I wrote to grab all of the cookies &#8230;

Must reference this when I talk about cookies and stuff .. 

this video is a harsh critique of Google & privacy. Apparently, it&#8217;s being broadcast in NY&#8217;s Times Square: http://bit.ly/bTIPO7

I should make sure I mention the privacy intrusion.
