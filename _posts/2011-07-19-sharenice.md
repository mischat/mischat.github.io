This post is about the [shareNice](http://sharenice.org/) social sharing widget I have been working on recently. I am pitching shareNice as a &#8220;uninstrusive social sharing&#8221; tool for webmasters. 

Webmasters can add shareNice to their websites if they want to let their users&#8217; share the pages they browse with their friend, via the many social networks platforms. 

So, what is different about shareNice, and why should you choose to use it? 

  * shareNice [respects your users&#8217; privacy](http://sharenice.org/website/privacy) .
  * shareNice is [ONLY a social sharing widget](http://sharenice.org/website/technical).
  * shareNice is not an analytic tool, we DO NOT log any of your user&#8217;s information.
  * shareNice does NOT track your users.
  * shareNice is [free-software and you can choose to host your own copy if you wish](https://github.com/mischat/shareNice).
  * shareNice is NOT a profit making endeavour.

Below is an example screenshot of the shareNice tool being used on  [The University of Southampton&#8217;s OpenData site](http://data.southampton.ac.uk).

[<img loading="lazy" alt="shareNice example" src="https://mmt.me.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/soton-shareNice.png" title="data.southampton.ac.uk shareNice integration" width="427" height="282" />](http://data.southampton.ac.uk/)



As it stands, shareNice is being used on the following sites : <http://data.southampton.ac.uk>, <http://www.garlik.com>, <https://mmt.me.uk/blog/>, and the <http://sharenice.org/> itself. And yes most of these sites are friendlies, but I would love to other people to start making use of the site too! 

We are currently working on a [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) plugin for the shareNice widget, and an [eprints](http://eprints.org/) plugin too. I would love if someone would like to create a [Drupal](http://drupal.org) plugin for shareNice, that would be great!. You can see a list of feature requests on : <http://sharenice.org/>.

Given that the apache instance which this runs off of doesn&#8217;t generate ANY logs, I have no way of know if people are using the service, so please do let me know. Either via my blog, twitter, or github. 

Finally, I should name dropped all the nice people which have helped in the development of shareNice: Monika Stepinska, Steve Harris, and Sebastien Francois. You guys rule!
